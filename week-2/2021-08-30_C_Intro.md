# Introduction to C

## Computer Organization
### History
- ENIAC (U.Penn., 1946): First electronic general-purpose computer
    - Fast (10 digits x 10 digits in 2.8 ms) but needed 2-3 days to setup new program with patch cords and switches
- EDSAC (Cambridge, 1949): First general stored-program computer
    - Programs held as numbers in memory; more programmable
    - 35-bit binary 2's complement words

### Components of a Computer

## Introduction to C
> *"The Universal Assembly Language"*
- High level to low level: Python > C > RISC-V/x86
- **Key concepts**: Pointers, Arrays, Implications for memory management

### Advantages
- Portable language to be used to write a portable operating system: UNIX
    - "Portable" here means a system that operates from processor to processor
- There are C compilers for all existing processors
- Derivatives: C++/Obj-C/C#
- Alternatives
    - Rust: "C but safe"
    - Go: Implicit parallelism
- Performs well on very small computers

## C Compilation
- Compiles directly into architecture-specific machine code (1's and 0's)
    - Unliked Java, which converts to architecture-independent "bytecode" which are interpreted by VM or a just-in-time compiler (JIT) to machine code
    - Unlike Python, which converts to a byte code at runtime
- Compiles source files (`.c`) to object files (`.o`), then links the `.o` files into executables

### Disadvantages
- Compiled files (executables) are architecture-specific and depends on processor type (eg. MIPS vs. x86 vs. RISC-V)
    - Executables must be rebuilt on each new system
- "Change => Compile => Run" iterative cycle can be slow during development
    - `make -j X` only rebuilts changed pieces and in parallel on multiple cores, reducing this disadvantage
    - Linker is sequential (Amdahl's Law)

### C Pre-Processor (CPP)
- `foo.c` -> CPP -> `foo.i` -> Compiler
- C source files first pass through macro preprocessor, CPP
- CPP commands begin with `#`
```c
#include "file.h" /* Inserts file.h into output */
#include "<stdio.h>" /* Looks for file in standard location */
#define M_PI 3.14159 /* Defines constant */
#if
#endif /* Conditional */
```
- Often used to create "small functions" (macros)
    - Not actual functions, just changes the text of the program
    - e.g. `#define twox(x) (x + x)`
- `#include` only *copies* the code into the file

## C Comparisons
- C has to allocate and free memory manually, or else you would run out of memory, or "memory leak" (`malloc`, `free`)

### Syntax

### Typed Variables in C

### Integers
- C `int` sizes depend on processor
- `sizeof(long long)` >= `sizeof(long)` >= `sizeof(int)` >= `sizeof(short)`
- `short` >= 16 bits
- `long` >= 32 bits
- All could be 64 bits

## C Syntax
### `const` and `enum`
```c
const float golden_ratio = 1.618;
const int days_in_week = 7;
const double the_law = 2.99792458e8;
```
- You can have a constant of any standard C variable types
- Enums: a group of related integer constants
```c
enum color (RED, GREEN, BLUE);
```

### Typed Functions
- You can specify return type `void` if the function does not return anything
```
int number_of_people ()
{
    return 3;
}

int sum ( int x, int y )
{
    return x + y;
}
```

### `struct`
- Structured groups of variables
- Uses the dot notation
```c
typedef struct {
    int length_int_seconds;
    int year_recorded;
} Song;

Song song1;
song1.length_in_seconds = 213;
song1.year_recorded = 1994;
```

### Hello World
Original C:
```c
main ()
{
    printf("\nHello World\n");
}
```

ANSI Standard C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) /* Must specify void for no arguments in ANSI C */
{
    printf("\nHello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### `main`
1. C executable `a.out` is loaded into memory by operating system
2. OS sets up stack, then calls into C runtime library
3. Runtime initializes memory and other libraries
4. Calls procedure named `main()`

### Table of Sines
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(void)
{
    int     angle_degree;
    double  angle_radian, pi, value;

    /* Print a header */
    printf("\nCompute a table of the sine function\n\n");

    pi = 4.0*atan(1.0);
    printf("Value of PI = %f \n\n", pi);
    printf("angle   Sine \n");
    angle_degree = 0;
    while (angle_degree <= 360)
    {
        angle_radian = pi * angle_degree / 180.0
        value = sin(angle_radian);
        printf(" %3d    %f \n ", angle_degree, value);
        angle_degree += 10;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
